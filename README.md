# Fission Reactor Physics Course

In this folder I collected some Homework Projects and Exercises carried out during the Fission Reactor Physics Course that I followed during my *Master Degree in Nuclear Engineering* at *Politecnico di Milano* (PoliMi).

## Topics of the Course:
* Nuclear Power Generation
* Nuclear Physics of Fission Chain Reactions
* Nuclear Reactors, Multiplication Factors and Reactor Criticality
* Neutron Transport
* One-speed Diffusion Theory Model
* Neutron Diffusion in Non-Multiplying Media
* Time-Independent Diffusion Equations and Criticality Conditions
* Nuclear Reactor Kinetics
* Point Reactor Kinetic Model
* Reactivity Feedbacks, Reactor Dynamics and Thermal-hydraulic coupling
* Multigroup Diffusion Theory

The course was a mix of theoretical lessons about Fission Reactor Physics and Exercise Sessions using Python to solve problems concerning Neutronics and Reactor Dynamics
