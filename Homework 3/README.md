# Homework 3 - Exercise about Multigroup Diffusion Theory

This Homework project has been carried out in the frame of the Fission Reactor Phyisics course.

## Context:
This is an exercise to try to implement and visualize the results that can be obtained applying the Multigroup Diffusion Theory.
The aim of the work is to determine the critical core width of a slab reactor with a PWR composition surrounded by an infinite water reflector, using the two-group theory.
