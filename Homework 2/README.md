# Homework 2 - Stability Analysis of Gen IV Nuclear Reactors coupling Neutroncs, Thermal-Hydraulics, Primary and Secondary Loops

This Homework project has been carried out in the frame of the course of Fission Reactor Physics.

## Context
The Generation IV International Form aims to develop the next generation of Nuclear Reactors. Six reactor concepts have been identified as suitable to satisfy outlined goals: THTR, MSR, SCWR, GFR, LFR and SFR.

A Stability Analysis is needed to verify the stability of Gen IV reactors following reactivity changes.

## Target System:
The Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor has been selected for investigations. This reactor is characterized by MOX fuel and liquid-Na as thermal vector.
Sodium is used as coolant for its good neutron properties, like low moderation effects and low neutron absorbing capabilities.
The high boiling point allows higher outlet coolant temperatures and unpressurized pool configuration, and high thermal conductivity ensures high heat transfer. The large amout of Na provides thermal inertia allowing the total negative feedback to work.
The reactivity control system consists of control rods containig Boron Carbide.

## Project Work:
A stability Analysis of the SFR has been performed. A non-linear model taking into account neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, primary and secondary loops has been studied using a state-space representation to compute the system response to the step reactivity insertion.
The stability maps have been studied for the system.
